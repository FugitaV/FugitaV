## 🚀 About Me
I am a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience developing and maintaining scalable systems, integrations, and backend solutions.  
I have strong expertise with Oracle B2C Service (RightNow), including custom controllers, widgets, CPMs, APIs, complex workflows, and system integrations across multiple clients.

Throughout my career, I have worked on projects involving large-scale data processing, architecture improvement, and creating stable, maintainable solutions. I am passionate about building clean and efficient backend systems while exploring new technologies to improve software quality and performance.
